Used Javascript, bootstrap, php, css, and html to make a fully responsive static website for a freelancer working for multifamily financing. Because github pages support only static websites, php does not work for emailing.

The client originally used it for 2015 ~ 2016, but then he stopped using it because he stopped running his business.
